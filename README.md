# A Queue using Lists #
This is just like the implementation of a queue in the repository
<a href="https://github.com/AmateurECE/Queue-Using-Arrays">
Queue-Using-Arrays</a>, only this one uses Linked Lists. I only tested for a
couple of different cases here, because Queues are kind of been-there,
done-that for me lately. Eventually I will update the test coverage to be more
thorough.
